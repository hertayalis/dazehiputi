First it was a kiss at a party, then it was a kiss in an Uber to her house where his car was parked, so where is the story connecting? When you’re lying, you can’t get your story straight. That’s why he was getting up multiple times to try to figure it out, but then would come back and put it on me.”</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Naturally, Rachel called off her engagement with Tino, and she has been pursuing life as a single woman.

Despite the duo missing a spark when they dated last year (causing him to be sent home week two), it looks like this flame may have finally ignited on the beach. “This is crazy, getting a second chance. I think things happen for a reason,” Rachel gushed after sharing a smooch with Jordan.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>While their relationship appears to be smooth sailing, Jordan is not the only man Rachel is seen exploring a connection with on Bachelor in Paradise…</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Later on in the trailer, we see Rachel on a date with (you guessed it) Brayden Bowers, the man she was attached at the hip with during the “After the Final Rose” episode last night. “A toast to finding someone who can match my crazy,” Brayden said, prior to clinking champagne glasses with Rachel.</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false><strong>Warning: the following section contains spoilers for&nbsp;season 9 of&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise.
