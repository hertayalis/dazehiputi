They have relationships, but they really don’t. They never hang up their spurs because of their kids. The things that really ground us and give us power, love, and a purpose? Those characters don’t experience it, and I think that’s not the way to make movies.”</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>The backlash from comic book movie fans was immediate and swift, with one commentator going so far as to say the main character in Avatar is not memorable, especially when compared to Iron Man or Batman.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed
