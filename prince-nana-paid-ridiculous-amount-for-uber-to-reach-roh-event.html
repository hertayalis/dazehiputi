This includes Prince Nana, who is undoubtedly one of the most over stars in the company thanks to his viral dance. Before signing with AEW, he ended up paying a ridiculous amount for an Uber to reach ROH Death Before Dishonor.</p><p>Prince Nana has been a part of Ring of Honor for a long time, with multiple runs over the years. He didn’t work with the promotion during the pandemic and wasn’t part of the first era of Tony Khan’s ROH last year.</p><p>He made his way to ROH last year during the Death Before Dishonor event, where he revealed his purchase of Tully Blanchard Enterprises.&nbsp;While speaking to&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Jericho on Talk Is Jericho</a>, Nana provided an explanation as to how he eventually signed with ROH/AEW. Prince Nana revealed that he even ended up taking an Uber for $650 just so that he could make it in time for ROH Death Before Dishonor.</p><p>“AEW was a company that was kind of birthed through ROH at that particular point in time. That first All In show, I wasn’t a part of it, I wanted to be a part of it, but history was made. The years went by, and I was beginning to kind of lose my luster because I had parted from Ring of Honor, it was still owned by Sinclair, and I had to make a decision on whether I was going to continue trying to perform or get a job doing something else. Luckily, I touched base with a couple of good friends, Homicide, Cary Silkin, CD [Christopher Daniels], and Nick Buck [Nick Jackson] and these guys encouraged me. ‘There may not be an opportunity right now, but keep doing your thing, go out there and try to get some local and national bookings.</p><p>Get your Embassy thing going.’ I took their advice, I did it, I did one dark match in New York with two local guys, it went well. Six months later, six months I was like, ‘I’m done. There is no going back to AEW. That was my little trinket,’ and then I’m in my basement, I’m there with one of my trusted advisors, sipping on some tea, shooting the shit, and out of the blue I get a text message. ‘How soon can you make it out to Boston?’ I jumped out of my seat. Everyone in the business knows that I don’t drive. I can drive, but I usually like to get driven. I looked at the schedule, it would have gotten me there at 8 PM. ‘We can’t do that, we need to get you here immediately.’ ‘I can jump in an Uber and be there in two or three hours.’ I’m in New York City, in Brooklyn.</p><p>Did the pricing for the Uber, it came out to $650. ‘Let’s do it.’ One Uber car came by, he saw where I was going, and said, ‘Sorry, I can’t do it.’ The next one came, ‘Sorry, I can’t do it.’ Third guy came, I begged him, I got on my knees for the first time in my life, got down on my knees and begged the driver, ‘Can you please take me to Boston. I’ll do whatever you want. I have a big tip for you. This is very important.’ He saw it in my eyes, ‘Get in the car,’ and that’s when history was made. I made it to Boston, met Tony Khan, he hired me on the spot, and history was made.”</p><p><a href=#>Prince Nana also recently signed new multi-year contract with AEW</a>, so he will be doing his viral dance for many years to come. He will be in Swerve Strickland’s corner for next his match against Bryan Danielson next week, so we’ll have to see how that match will turn out.</p><p>What’s your opinion on what Prince Nana said?
