Excellent acting and a nicely timed twist at the end. The perfect chiller for a hot summer day (or night).</p>— Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href=#>July 8, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Director Alice Troughton’s unheralded thriller – which boasts a Certified Fresh approval rating of 86 percent on Rotten Tomatoes – finds Daryl McCormack’s aspiring writer accepting a tutoring position at the sprawling estate of Richard E. Grant’s legendary author. However, it doesn’t take long for the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed upstart to discover something is seriously amiss with the Sinclair family, who draw him deeper and deeper into a web of intrigue, secrets, and revenge.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>The Lesson only released yesterday, too, so King clearly hasn’t wasted any time attempting to mobilize the troops and ensure it finds a sizeable audience, which it no doubt will. After all, if the titan of terror himself is heartily endorsing an acclaimed genre tale, then plenty of folks will be emboldened to seek it out for themselves as a result of his thumbs-up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqq2doJ2yr3nKoqWgq12hrrWx0q1koKSfrLavs4yrnJynnaKyr7DAraCopl2drqq40maroZ1dpbKzssScq2abmJ65rbHRZp2oql2Weqm702aqrqWdmr9usMCyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./702075-lcs-franchise-slot-sale-dgon.html><span>←</span><span>Mystery Team Rumored To Have Sold Their LCS Spot</span></a>
