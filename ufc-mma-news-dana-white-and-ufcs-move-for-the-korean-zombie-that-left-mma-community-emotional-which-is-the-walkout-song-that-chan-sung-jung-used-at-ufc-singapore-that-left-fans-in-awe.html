<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Dana White and UFCs Move for the Korean Zombie That Left MMA CommunityEmotional: Which Is the Wa</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>The Korean Zombie</a> introduced himself to the UFC community with a win over Leonard Garcia via a rarely seen ‘Twister’ choke in 2011. Since then, his humble nature and superb fight skills have garnered praise from a plethora of UFC audiences. His unique nickname and awesome in-octagon prowess with wins over noted fighters like <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dustin Poirier</a> established him as one of the major forces in the UFC’s Featherweight division. But in the end, ‘Father Time’ caught up to the Zombie as well.</p><p>Most fans might agree that it’s a commendable task to build a twelve-year-long career in the UFC. Although ‘The Korean Zombie’ managed to bag this achievement, he decided to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>give up stretching his tenure any further</a> after the recently concluded UFC Singapore. But Sung Jung might have anticipated a better finish to his final bout in the UFC.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>The Korean Zombie’s last stand: A farewell retirement after intense bout</h2><p>‘The Korean Zombie’ Chan Sung Jung readily accepted the former UFC Featherweight king <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Max Holloway’s</a> callout after the latter’s UFC Kansas City victory. But as the fight night drew closer, rumors started flying that it might be Sung Jung’s final fight in the UFC. Before UFC Singapore on August 26th, several prominent MMA news sources had published reports about Sung Jung’s last UFC fight being the main event.</p><p>Both combatants came out guns blazing in the bout. ‘The Korean Zombie’ looked a lot more aggressive than his usual nature right from the opening minutes of the bout. However, Holloway kept getting the better of most of the exchanges with him. ‘Blessed’ also drove Sung Jung to the canvas with a vicious right hand in the second round and tried to score an arm triangle submission. But, ‘The Korean Zombie’ proved too tough for Holloway to submit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1324453408.jpg><p>‘The Korean Zombie’ decided to go for a rush on Holloway right in the beginning seconds of the third round. But, Holloway got the better of this exchange as well. Sung Jung’s forward momentum and another strong right hand from ‘Blessed’ combined to form the final blow that ended the bout in the latter’s favor.</p><p>A heartwarming show of respect between the two followed the fight. After Holloway’s post-fight interview, ‘The Korean Zombie’ actually declared his retirement from the UFC, turning the rumors true. The incredible Singapore crowd thanked him with all their hearts for his superb contribution to the sport.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Dana White and UFC pay their respects as The Korean Zombie’s walkout song continues playing after fight</h2><p>As most UFC fans might already know, ‘The Korean Zombie’ walks out to the legendary alternative-grunge rock song ‘Zombies’ by the noted Irish rock band, ‘The Cranberries’. But his UFC Singapore walkout stood out from all other UFC walkouts of his career. The superbly sporting Singapore crowd sounded much like a trained choir while they sang along ‘Zombies’ with Sung Jung walking out to it.</p><p>Post the declaration of Sung Jung’s retirement, Dana White and Co. found nothing more appropriate to honor ‘The Korean Zombie’ than his walkout theme of ‘Zombies’. The Singapore crowd singing along to ‘Zombies’ also made them hail and chant the name of ‘The Korean Zombie’ partially.</p><p>As a result, the UFC authorities kept playing the song until its full length. This followed Sung Jung’s declaration that he wouldn’t return to the octagon for another showdown. He also remained absent from the post-event press conference, which left the fans in a blank space regarding what he was planning to do next.</p><p>Did you find the ‘Zombie’-themed farewell to ‘The Korean Zombie’ by the UFC appealing?
