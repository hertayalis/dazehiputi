know we know it and there’s no better day than today to check out Alison Brie’s height, weight and body, but before we get on that train, let’s see some fun facts about Alison Brie. actress herself.</span></p><p><span>See Also: Jennifer Aniston’s Nose Job, House, Legs & Diet</span></p><ul><li><span>She was born Alison Brie Schermerhorn on December 29, 1982.</span></li><li><span>In high school, she performed as a clown for children’s birthday parties.&nbsp;The company she worked for was based in Compton, and her clown name was Sunny;&nbsp;so yeah, she was literally a clown, a few years before she went to CalArts, and there are the kiddie parties to prove it.</span></li><li><span>Her love for the craft didn’t start naïvely recently;&nbsp;when she was growing up, she put on shows for her family, including a fake commercial for “smoked sausages”, for which she wore only a coat and a hot dog between her legs.</span></li><li><span>The first character she played was Toto in the production of her film&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Wizard of Oz</span></strong><span>, while her first television appearance was on an episode of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Hannah Montana</span></strong><span>&nbsp;in 2006.</span></li><li><span>Actually, here’s an interesting question: Brie listens to “hardcore rap” to pass herself off for auditions.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Acting is not her only talent, she also sings very well… So much so that she is part of a cover band with the other two actresses, Cyrina Fiallo and Julianna Guill.&nbsp;The group,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>The Girls</span></strong><span>, perform folk versions of their favorite songs.</span></li><li><span>She has a silly side… one of her hobbies is to mimic memes and believe us when we say she can mimic almost any meme.</span></li><li><span>Talking about multitasking in its heyday, Alison sometimes had to film episodes of both&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Mad Men</span></strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Community</span></strong><span>&nbsp;in a Day.</span></li><li><span>The star revealed in an interview with the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>LA Times</span></strong><span>&nbsp;that the role she most wants to play is that of a mental person… So we can’t wait to see her tap into her dark, deep side one of these days. .</span></li></ul><p><span>Let’s not get carried away by the star’s astonishment, it’s time to examine the subject starting with Alison Brie.</span></p><p><span>See also: Height of Shakira Body weight and measurements</span></p><h2><span>Alison Brie’s Height</span></h2><p><span>Calling her a pretty little lady is quite accurate in every sense of the word, as the star is not only pretty but as petite as she comes.&nbsp;She’s 5ft 3in and a testament to how tall isn’t everything, after all the little girls having fun.</span></p><p><span>She has very tall and equally short actors in some of her series, so it might be difficult to gauge her height from time to time.&nbsp;For example, on&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Community</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Joel Mchale outclasses her at 6ft 4in, but she’s right at home with the girls despite Gillian Jacobs being only 5ft 4in and Yvette Nicole Brown was 5ft 2in.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, here is a list of notablecelebrities as great as her.&nbsp;Scarlett Johansson, Kim Kardashian, Natalie Portman, Vanessa Paradis and Mila Kunis share Alison Brie’s highlights.</span></p><p><span>See also: Katy Perry Height, Weight Net Worth</span></p><h2><span>Alison Brie’s Weight</span></h2><p><span>It would be a taboo for her to weigh too much Given her small stature, we think that’s why the star is taking the time to keep her 50 pounds off.&nbsp;So how exactly does she do it?&nbsp;While she most likely has an entire routine going for her, a few go to things that really get her going.</span></p><p><span>The actress calls yoga “her church” and says running never feels like strenuous exercise because it clears her head.&nbsp;Sounds simple and doable, doesn’t it?&nbsp;Well, the best advice we can give you is to tell you to try it at home.</span></p><p><span>See also: Jennifer Lopez Feet, Shoe Size and Shoe Collection</span></p><h2><span>Alison Brie body measurements</span></h2><p><span>Along with
