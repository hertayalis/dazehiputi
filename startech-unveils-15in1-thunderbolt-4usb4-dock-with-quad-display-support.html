The unit comes with one Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 port with a 98W power delivery capability to connect to the host, a 2.5 GbE adapter, six USB Type-A ports (three supporting 10 Gbps, two supporting 5 Gbps, and one being USB 2.0 for up to 7.5W charging), one USB Type-C connector (at 10 Gbps), four display outputs (two DP 1.4, two HDMI 2.1), an SD Card reader with UHS-II, a microSD card reader with UHS-II, and a 3.5-mm audio jack.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21306/132n-tb4usb4dock.c.eg_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The dock's main selling feature is, its support for up to four displays. Of course, this is a valuable capability, but it has a couple of catches. The device can support four 4Kp60 displays when connected to a laptop featuring Intel's 12th or 14th Generation Core processor using a Thunderbolt 4 or USB 4 connector and with DSC enabled. With AMD Ryzen 6000 and Intel's 11th Gen Core-based systems, only three 4Kp60 displays are supported. Meanwhile, with MacBooks, users must get on with two 5Kp60 or one 6Kp60 display. The good news is that the Thunderbolt 4 Quad Display Docking Station requires no drivers and works seamlessly with MacOS, Windows, and ChromeOS.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21306/132n-tb4usb4dock-D_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The docking station has a 180W power supply, so it can simultaneously charge a laptop and power on all the remaining ports.</p><p>Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 docks with rich capabilities are not cheap as they have to pack loads of quite expensive controllers, and StarTech's 15-in-1 docking station is no exception, as it costs&nbsp;<a href=#>$330.99</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The StarTech.com Thunderbolt 4 Quad Display Docking Station is available for purchase directly from the company and through various IT resellers and distributors such as CDW, Amazon, Ingram Micro, TD SYNNEX, and D&H.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/21306/132n-tb4usb4dock.d.eg_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH9yf49vZqyskafBpq%2FHZqynrpWeubR5kG6gp2ldqbW2usOeqZunnKl6dcHSm2tmnJ%2BYuG7DyK2fZqmllrFusMisp6WZqWLAtrzPqKmt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nottrebeca-net-worth-314622.html><span>←</span><span>nottrebeca Net Worth</span></a>
