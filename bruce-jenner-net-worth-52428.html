He added: "People began tweeting the other, harder things women have to deal with, such as institutionalized oppression, abuse and sexual assault". James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, the only female New York Police Department officer to die on September 11, 2001, returned Moira's "Woman of the Year" award, given posthumously. Referring to Jenner as a man, he stated that he found <i>Glamour</i> giving Jenner the same award insulting to Moira's memory, and referred to the matter as a publicity stunt. Smith later said that, having supported transgender youth and <i>Glamour</i><span class=nowrap>'s</span> decision to honor transgender <a href=#>Actress</a> Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner's "hardest part about being a woman" commentary; this proved to him that Jenner "is not truly a woman. I believe this comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeSp8KksYyjnKemlad6r7HTZq6oqqSdenZ%2Bk2tv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-hushpuppi-top-secrets-finally-exposed-which-might-cause-his-release-soon.html><span>←</span><span>BREAKING; Hushpuppi Top Secrets Finally Exposed Which Might Cause His Release Soon</span></a>
