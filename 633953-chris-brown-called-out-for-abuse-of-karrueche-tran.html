Furthermore, these attacks came after the singer exploded on Instagram, criticizing <a href=# rel>critics of his past violence</a> against his ex <a href=# class=text-word rel>Rihanna</a>. However, many pointed out that his actions form into a repeated pattern of mistreatment. Moreover, the court issued a five year restraining order against Brown in Tran's favor back in 2017. Their case stemmed from occasions when he threatened her with violence when they broke up, and beat her previously.</p><p>NEW YORK, NY - FEBRUARY 17: Chris Brown (R) and Karrueche Tran are seen during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Fall 2015 at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on February 17, 2015 in New York City. (Photo by Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images)</p><p>"It's funny how Chris Brown always forgets to mention how he abused and harassed Karrueche to a point where she had to get a <a href=# rel>restraining order</a> on him," one person tweeted. "It's not about one singular thing it's your whole history of abuse." Also, other users acknowledged that this is a much less known-about case than Brown's actions against Rihanna. "People who defend Chris Brown, only bring up Rihanna & how she forgave him. They never mention the restraining order with Karrueche Tran. Him throwing her downstairs, punching her in the stomach & harassment, his colorist or holding a woman hostage with a gun etc. Says a lot."</p><p>Furthermore, one Twitter user in particular had a lengthy statement on their acknowledgement of Brown's actions from a fan perspective. "What Rihanna <a href=# rel>decided</a> after CB abused her should have nothing to do with where your integrity, morals, and beliefs stand. Victims of DV tend to forgive/go back to their abusers often. Also that wasn't a one and done. CB was hell on wheels after that. Ask Karrueche Tran about that restraining order that was granted to 5 yrs. Ask dark skinned women, ask the folks at GMA. Look, I still listen to his music, but I'm also not being intellectually dishonest and rewriting history in order to make me feel ok in the fact that I still snap my fingers to 'No Guidance' and 'Strip.'</p><p>"Stop acting like that pic of Rihanna's face beaten wasn't that big of a deal because 'she forgave him,'" they continued. "Stop acting like a 5 year restraining order isn't a big deal, stop acting like being a colorist isn't a big deal. Just say I know he has violent and problematic ways however, I still choose to support him. And in all honesty thats the issue. Y'all don't want to say that because you know how it sounds so y'all rewrite history and lie about his ways in order to <a href=# rel>feel justified in your support of him</a>. It's ok."
