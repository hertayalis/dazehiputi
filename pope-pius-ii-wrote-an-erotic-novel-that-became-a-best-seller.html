Titled "The Tale of Two Lovers" (or, as it's called in Italian, "Historia de duobus amantibus"),&nbsp;the work&nbsp;tells the story of a forbidden love that takes place between a married woman and a representative of the Duke of Austria, both of whom develop feelings for one another despite their better judgment. While it's certainly not akin to anything <a href=#>the Marquis De Sade</a> would deem erotic, the notion of a pope publishing a story about lust and marital malfeasance was highly controversial.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Piccolomini wasn't actually a pope at the time the work was penned. Per the National Library of Scotland, he received his holy coronation in&nbsp; 1458 and officially became Pope Pius II on September 3. However, he only held the title for a total of six years, dying in August of 1464. "A Tale of Two Lovers" was published posthumously three years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCElG1nbXFfpbyxsYypoK6rXZ62bsPRqKueZZGjeqa%2Bzq2gnGWepMOmuIytn5qsXZeypK3MnmSaZZKawLV50p6jpZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cooking-shrimp-mashed-potatoes-plane-bathroom.html><span>←</span><span>No Fly List Coming in Hot Man Cooks Shrimp, Mashed Potatoes in Airplane Bathroom Mid-Fligh</span></a>
