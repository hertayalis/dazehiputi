I’m not worried about the youth. Young people aren’t just looking back. They are also looking forward.”&nbsp;<strong>– Neil Young</strong></p><p>“For whatever you’re doing, for your creative juices, your geography’s got a hell of a lot to do with it. You really have to be in a good place, and then you have to be either on your way there or on your way from there.”&nbsp;<strong>– Neil Young</strong></p><p>“A lot of people that buy vinyl today don’t realize that they’re listening to CD masters on vinyl and that’s because the record companies have figured out that people want vinyl, And they’re only making CD masters in digital, so all the new products that come out on vinyl are actually CDs on vinyl, which is really nothing but a fashion statement.”&nbsp;<strong>– Neil Young</strong></p><p>“Back then, people closed their eyes and listened to music. Today there’s a lot of images that go with the music. A lot of music is crap, and it’s all commercial, and the images are all trying to sell the record.”&nbsp;<strong>– Neil Young</strong></p><p>“All these people talking about morality should take a walk downtown.
