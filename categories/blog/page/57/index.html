[Verse 1]
I can't sleep tonight, wide awake and so confused.
Everything is in line, but I am bruised.
I need a voice to echo, I need a light to take me home.
I kinda need a hero, is it you?[Pre-Chorus]
I never see the forest for the trees, I could really use your melody.
Baby I'm a little blind, I think it's time for you to find me.
