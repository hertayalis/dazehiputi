"We're both pretty good-sized humans and it just wasn't really working when she was in her third trimester, and I also have sleep apnea, which is very sexy for the ladies out there, I'm sure," Carson said. "She couldn't get comfortable, so we were like a commercial you would see, kicking each other and just not sleeping."</p><p>The couple unilaterally decided to just call it a day — or rather, a good night — on sharing a bed, and they never looked back, especially after their fourth child was born. Carson, who wakes up at 3 a.m. to film Today, didn't want to risk waking his wife and daughter, so he stayed in a separate room. He ultimately found that having more energy actually helped his relationship rather than hurt it. "I don't know if we'll ever sleep together again," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2piaIV0e9KtqZqml5p6tbTIp56sZZGXvLbAjJyYq6ufo3qlrcuyqmalkae%2Fqq3GnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./madison-keys-has-emotional-press-conference-after-us-open-loss.html><span>←</span><span>Madison Keys has emotional press conference after US Open loss</span></a>
