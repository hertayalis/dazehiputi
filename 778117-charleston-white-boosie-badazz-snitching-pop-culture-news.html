White was allegedly reporting Boosie for threatening a show promoter in Memphis who had booked White. White did not make the call in the video and it is unclear if he followed through with his stated plan.

Last year, he went off on a livestreamed anti-Semitic rant during a beef with Ross. "F-ck that white boy [Ross], f-ck them Jew motherf-ckers. They don't know sh-t, n-gga. They don't know how to treat no n-gga. The Jews? Nah nah, we're the real motherf-cking Jews. The nappy-hat n-gga that was in chains. F-ck the Jews, man. The Holocaust was fake. Yeah, the Holocaust was some made-up sh-t. They made up some sh-t. Like Valentine Day and Christmas, made up. F-ck you talking about - when Jesus was born there weren't even no December. It's fake y'all. Adin and his line motherf-ckers. F-ck them. I rock with Hitler. Hitler-loving motherf-cker. They fly me out here. I f-cking love Hitler. Heil motherf-cking Hitler [White performs a Nazi salute]. The motherf-cking Jews ain't suffered what the motherf-cking n-gga suffered," White ranted.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Later that same day, White declared that he would rather "rape a sister than get with a Jew b-tch". However, after receiving intense backlash online, White walked back his comments. In a tearful livestream, White claimed that he didn't believe the things he had said and that he simply "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">played a character online</a>".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbIVyfZZmmqGZoqGytMDOp2SwoJmpsm6uzqiqop1dl66lrdmzZKymmamwqbXNoGSpp6BisLa4066pnmWemsS0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zachery-ty-bryan-girlfriend-wife.html><span>←</span><span>'Home Improvement' Star Zachery Ty Bryan Arrested for Alleged Domestic Violence</span></a>
