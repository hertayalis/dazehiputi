In the past, the pop star has been linked to the likes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Styles</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Mayer</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Alwyn</a>, each of whom <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">likely inspired a hit song</a> that’s no-doubt still buzzing inescapably around your head.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Taylor-Swift-Tortured-Poets-Department-5.jpg><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>It’s Swift’s current romance with NFL tight end <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a> that has attracted the most buzz, probably because of the high school cheerleader-meets-lovable-jock storyline that seems built-in to their relationship. But before he was attached to the hip of the most recognisable woman in the world, Travis Kelce was the star of a short-lived reality television dating show. Here’s everything we know about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catching Kelce</a>.</p><h2 id=h-the-travis-kelce-dating-show-explained data-injectable=false>The Travis Kelce dating show, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>Catching Kelce aired on E! in 2016. At the time, Kelce was newly signed to his current team, the Kansas City Chiefs, and was garnering attention for his affable personality off the field. Enjoying a one-season, seven-episode run, Catching Kelce documented the namesake athlete’s attempt to find love from a dating pool of 50 women, with one from each state (that seems like a lot of work).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>The Bachelor-style series had an early frontrunner in the form of Kentucky’s Maya Benberry, who would go on to become the last woman standing by the show’s end. Benberry was chosen as one of the contenders in Kelce’s very first group date in episode two, though she was shown to be quite competitive as the series progressed. Benberry was considered cutthroat in her approach to the show, and Kelce’s manager said she reminded him of the footballer’s ex-girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>Benberry was nonetheless chosen by Kelce in the finale, with the runner-up being New Jersey resident Veronica Harwood. The latter was the first contestant to get a solo date with Kelce, and was among the four to reach the finale alongside Benberry, Avery Schlereth from Colorado, and Lauren Schwab from Missouri.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>Other notable moments from the show included the mass departure of 30 women following a speed dating session in the premiere, a cameo appearance from Red Foo of LMFAO, and the increasing competition among the bachelorettes as numbers began to dwindle. There’s also a subplot involving one contestant’s claim to have dated actor/model Fabio, and another moment in which a castmate kisses Kelce on the spot after he put her in the friend-zone.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>As for Kelce’s thoughts on the show years on from its release, the footballer seems somewhat apathetic about the experience. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> that he doesn’t really reflect on the Catching Kelce era, and has elsewhere claimed that the show didn’t represent him accurately.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>In any case, Kelce has since found his match in Swift, and this time there’s even more cameras ready to capture it all.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMramarpmoeqyxy5ycZpyRqbavs4ysn6ivXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./phil-swift-net-worth-224059.html><span>←</span><span>Phil Swift Net Worth 2024</span></a>
