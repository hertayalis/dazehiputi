"And when I was spending time with Michael, yep we had a little peck, a little kiss. That's absolutely fine! Everyone does it." The social media beauty went on to say that she can't quickly switch off her feelings, admitting: "I still do have feeling for him, I can't switch them off."</p><p id=eU50NB3XS73p data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>BBC Breakfast presenter is the sixth Strictly Come Dancing contestant</a></strong></p><p id=eKzzgIiepHYX data-wc=66>After Joanna was dumped from the villa, Michael described her as "standoffish" in their relationship. Watching from home, Joanna was shocked to hear the surprise confession, telling "I've had to pause the TV. For me, being standoffish is me having respect for those in the villa because someone is hurting in there. It's hard for me to watch this right now. I'm not going to lie."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3a4a72cb3b38-joanna-chimonides-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eIkQv0VAX5Ts data-wc=6><strong>Joanna still has feelings for Michael</strong></p><p id=eb3R2g7bXM3R data-wc=55>She continued: "In all honesty that was so hard for me to watch and right now I really don’t have any words.

But right now, we just want to see if we can have a conversation about things and move from there because we don’t actually know what’s going to happen." He added: "We don’t know what’s going on in each other’s lives, how busy we’re going to be, stuff like that.
