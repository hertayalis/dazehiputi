She was born in 1990 in Paris, France, making her 11 years old when the first Potter film was released. She is currently 32 years old.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>Her first-ever film role was in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, which was released in 2001 and directed by Chris Columbus. She also starred as the Disney princess Belle in the live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in 2017, directed by Bill Condon. She also had roles in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, in which she played Samantha “Sam” Button, and Sofia Coppola’s The Bling Ring, in which she played Nicki Moore.</p><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Watson’s activism work includes being a United Nations Women Goodwill Ambassador. She is also closely associated with the movement HeforShe, which she helped launch as a part of the United Nations. The idea behind the movement is to encourage men to advocate for gender equality. Advocating for women, and as a feminist, she helps promote education for young women and girls. She was also a founding member of Time’s Up UK, which was founded to support sexual harassment victims as a response to the Harvey Weinstein allegations and the #MeToo movement that followed.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Aside from her activism and acting, the actress prefers to stay away from the spotlight, as she has no doubt had her fair share of it. Hopefully, she’ll continue to be the great advocate that she has been ever since Harry Potter ended and also get back to acting more regularly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMqKOdZZmoeqa5zJpksJmkqLyvew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lucas-bryant-and-kirsty-hinchcliffe.html><span>←</span><span>Couple Comparison - Lucas Bryant and Kirsty Hinchcliffe</span></a>
