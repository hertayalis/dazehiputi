He founded the Islamist organization known as Al Qaeda and orchestrated the largest terrorist attacks in the history of the United States on September 11, 2001.</p><p>Following these attacks, Osama became one of the most infamous and sought-after terrorists in the world.</p><p>As for his wealth, sources estimate Osama Bin Laden’s net worth to be as high as $50 million, most of which was inherited from his father, Mohammed Bin Awad Bin Laden, who was very affluent.</p><h3>Osama Bin Laden’s Net Worth: $50 Million</h3><p>Osama Bin Laden received his education from an elite high school and later attended King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia, where he initially pursued a business administration and economics diploma but eventually obtained a civil engineering degree in 1979. He furthered his education by receiving a diploma in public administration in 1981, showcasing a contrasting side of a well-educated individual who later perpetrated such attacks.</p><p>Reports indicate that Osama became involved with radical organizations during his time as a student. One of the first organizations he joined was a mujahideen force focused on the expulsion of Soviet citizens from Afghanistan. Osama played a significant role in the organization, particularly in its financing, and contributed to arming fighters from Arabia who were involved in the conflict. This positioned him as one of the most notorious figures in Afghanistan at the time.</p><p>Although Al Qaeda was established in 1988, due to its activities in 1992, Osama was compelled to leave Saudi Arabia and chose to reside in Sudan. Ultimately, American pressure led him to leave Sudan as well. Subsequently, he moved to Afghanistan to use it as a base for anti-American activities. Osama Bin Laden is often attributed responsibility for various bombings of US embassies in different locations.</p><p>Osama Bin Laden’s legacy in terrorist attacks earned him worldwide notoriety. Despite being widely recognized as a negative figure, it is a fact that he inherited tremendous wealth from his father and effectively utilized it to cause devastating consequences.</p><p>On a personal note, Osama bin Laden was known to have been married to at least five wives and fathered over 20 children, many of whom reportedly fled to Iran following the 2001 attacks and are currently under close surveillance by the authorities.</p><p>He met his demise on May 2, 2011, in Pakistan, where he was killed by the United States military. It is known that the US possessed direct evidence of Bin Laden’s location in Pakistan.</p><h3>Structural Information</h3><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Osama bin Laden</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 10, 1957</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.95 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>approximately 73 kilograms</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Engineer, Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>King Abdulaziz University, Al-Thager Model School, Brummana High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Saudi</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Amal al-Sadah, Siham Sabar, Khairiah Sabar, Najwa bin Laden</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>(List of children)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Hamida al-Attas, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>(List of siblings)</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td><a href=# rel=noopener>IMDB Profile</a></td></tr></table><h3>Quotes</h3><table class=quotes><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>We are against the American system, not against its people.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I have already said that I am not involved in the September 11th attacks in the United States.
