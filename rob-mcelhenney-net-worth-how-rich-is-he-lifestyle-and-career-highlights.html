Because of his great stint on the television sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, the talented actor has acquired a fortune. The first episode of the show had a very low budget of only $200.

Similarly, he earns approximately $2 million per month. Aside from acting, the actor also works as a playwright and producer. As a co-owner of a Welsh football team, he also makes money.

McElhenney also profits from reruns of his programs. Furthermore, Rob deposits tens of millions of dollars in his bank through repeats, and this is only one network’s investment.</p><h2><span id=Lifestyle>Lifestyle</span></h2><p>Robert McElhenney III, sometimes known as Robert McElhenney, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 14, 1977. He was raised in a Catholic environment by his mother and two brothers. McElhenney’s parents divorced when he was eight years old. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at Temple University.</p><p>Robert met his future wife, Kaitlin Olson, on the set of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, when he hired her as an actor to play Dee.
