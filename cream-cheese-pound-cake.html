Cake flour contains less gluten which helps to create a tender, light crumb in cakes. Add cake flour in increments and don’t overmix, which can create toughness.</li><li><strong>Everything is Better with Butter</strong>. The benefit of butter is that it not only adds essential fats but also brings the flavor. It helps to create a rich, buttery flavor in this pound cake recipe. This recipe calls for 3 sticks of butter which makes it extra moist and buttery.</li><li><strong>Bring on the Cream Cheese</strong>. The cream cheese adds some tang to the cake while bringing extra tenderness and richness. The key is to cream the butter, cream cheese, and sugar together until light and fluffy. This helps to create a smooth texture.</li><li><strong>Add Whole Milk and Eggs</strong>. This has a good amount of eggs and egg yolks. The extra egg yolks add moisture and fat which binds the cake together. My favorite vanilla is the <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0013ABIXY data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><span><strong>Blue Cattle Truck Mexican Vanilla</strong></span></a>. I buy it in the <a href=# rel=noopener><span><strong>half gallon size</strong></span></a> and then use a funnel to put it in these <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B07794BDKD data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong><span>4-ounce amber colored glass bottles</span></strong></a>. It is a huge money saver! You can even share the half gallon amongst friends for additional savings.</li><li><strong>Spray a Nonstick Bundt Pan with Baking Spray with Flour</strong>. This is a key step in order to remove the finished cake from the bundt pan. Make sure that every nook and cranny has a good amount of baking spray on it to make it easy to remove. Here are a few favorite bundt pans —&nbsp;<a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B06VTJJ5DL data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong><span>Nordic Ware Gold Premier Anniversary Bundt Pan</span></strong></a> or <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B06XSQVRHG data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong><span>Nordicware Crown Bundt Pan</span></strong></a>.</li><li><strong>Bake just until Cake Tester comes clean.</strong> You never want to overbake a cake until it is a hard as a rock. You want it to be moist and tender so that is why it is imperative to test the cake for doneness.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cream-Cheese-Pound-Bundt-Cake-4.jpg alt="The BEST Cream Cheese Pound Cake.
