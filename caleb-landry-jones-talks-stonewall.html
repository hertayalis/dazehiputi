Already set to star Jeremy Irvine as Danny, a “a young man who experiences a political awakening during the Stonewall riots,” the film will see Jones co-star as Orphan Annie, “an eccentric gay street hustler who participates alongside Danny in the uprising."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The director is usually known for his big, loud, end of the world films like Independence Day, 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow. Despite the departure, I think that it will be nice to see Emmerich try his hand at something different. He’s definitely good at what he does, but it’s always interesting to see a director step out of their comfort zone and tackle something new.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>As for Jones, I’ve seen him in both&nbsp;First Class&nbsp;and&nbsp;Antiviral, as well as a few of his other films, and I definitely have him pegged as an actor to look out for.&nbsp;Stonewall&nbsp;should give him some meaty material to sink his teeth into and I’m looking forward to seeing him in another big role.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=false>Tell us, what do you think of Roland Emmerich switching gears with&nbsp;<strong>Stonewall</strong>?
