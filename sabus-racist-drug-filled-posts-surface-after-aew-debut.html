They certainly didn’t think that Sabu would show up, but <a href=#>that is exactly what happened</a>. Then, a ton of things came out about Sabu that AEW probably didn’t expect.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of AEW Dynamite this week.</a></p><p><a href=#>Sabu and Renee Paquette</a> went at it in 2018, and the ECW Orginal didn’t come off in the best light. Those old tweets said, “She is the 1st non f*g, but she is one of many c*ck s*ckers.” Naturally, fans grilled him at the time, and that tweet resurfaced in a big way.</p><p>Another Instagram story started making the rounds. This post from Sabu featured a small bag full of pink powder on a tray. We do not know exactly what was in Sabu’s bag, but we’re hoping that he did. Also, fans grilled Tony Khan for allowing someone with such a loose policy on drug use backstage.</p><p>Ryan Satin also tweeted out to remind fans about an article that ran on <a href=#>Pro Wrestling Sheet </a>years ago about Sabu. In that article, he called Taz the N-Word, and he was not sorry about that at all.</p><p>We reached out to Sabu asking why he believes it’s kosher to use such offensive terms and he responded saying, “Grow up every one is a little bit racist. Even ur mother.” Brunk&nbsp;adds, “I am not a racist but I don’t care if a n***er that called me a drug addict thinks so.”</p><p>AEW did not announce that they signed Sabu to a deal. He will only be in Adam Cole’s corner at Double or Nothing. After the viral reaction that Sabu received after his AEW debut, we have to wonder if Tony Khan is regretting this decision.</p><p>Tony Khan has brought in a few controversial stars in the past, and some of them don’t have the best track record. Only time will tell how often Sabu appears for AEW, but he’s booked for Double or Nothing.</p><p>What’s your take on Sabu showing up in AEW?
