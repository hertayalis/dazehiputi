Skin care is everything, you are NEVER too young to start babying your skin," she said. Fans were quick to agree, commenting: "Yes! I admire your skincare regimen!" and "I absolutely love this stuff!!

She shared a message on Instagram stating her results were benign: "It's had been 16 years since I had a biopsy because no one told me I needed to get another. Over the last 2 years my body was so inflamed from my breast implant illness that my thyroid nodule doubled in size. It was time for another biopsy. I had it on Monday. Finally. I woke up today to this message. I am lucky, yes, but I'll never wait that long again. Implants out, thyroid benign, on to dancing and healing! TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF! SELF LOVE IS THE BEST LOVE!"</p><p id=eyOUUeFMN8xS data-wc=34>We can safely say none of it is affecting her dancing abilities, with the star achieving thirty two for her Viennese Waltz – and her skin looks amazing too!
