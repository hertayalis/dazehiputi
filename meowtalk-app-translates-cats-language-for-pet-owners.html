They also can update with custom messages such as, “I want my toy!”</p><p>Users can record their cat’s meow to decode what it means — but the ultimate goal is coming up with a collar that will be able translate with a vocal response.</p><p>Sanchez used a prototype unit on his own kitten, whose meow was translated as, “I’m angry!
