They're like, 'Oh, it's you.

"Some people had partners that came [to set]. Most people were alone, I think. A lot of people had children too, but maybe a little bit older. I just had a tiny, tiny baby," she said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/21d34eb57016-scarlett-johansson-kissing-colin-jost.jpg><p id=eW07eTs1KbG data-wc=38>Scarlett and Colin <a class=hm-link href=#>confirmed Cosmo's arrival</a> in August 2021, with the former star sharing a post on Instagram, which read: "Ok, ok, we had a baby. His name is Cosmo. We love him very much."&nbsp;</p><p id=e-ChmaKSUjt data-wc=29>During an appearance on last September, Scarlett shared the heartfelt meaning behind Cosmo's quirky moniker and the connection it shares to her daughter, Rose's name.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAC-WFOXP-e data-wc=39>"They are both flowers," she told <a class=hm-link href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>. "Not a lot of people make that connection. Cosmo is a really sweet little flower that comes in different shades of orange and yellow. That's why my daughter liked it too."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/81f3be86df88-scarlett-johansson-husband-colin-jost.jpg><p id=ePvHPN_12UY data-wc=44>While Scarlett and Colin love Cosmo's name, with the actress calling it "refreshing" and "charming", Colin's mother took a little while to get used to it. "She kept suggesting other versions of it and I'm like, 'No, he's already here, he's out,'" she added.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePP1A1goPS data-wc=25>Back in January, Colin appeared on and divulged another insight about Cosmo when asked how he is finding fatherhood.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekrho4i0x0B data-wc=20><strong>"It's great!
