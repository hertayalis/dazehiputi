We’ve been thinking about your son Wolfie. And we’re just wondering how you’re doing at this moment.”</p><p id=par-3_48>“It’s so good to see you guys too,” Bertinelli said, clearly holding back her tears. “I don’t know why I’m tearing up.

You gave me the one true light in my life, our son, Wolfgang,” she wrote along with a family photo. “Through all your challenging treatments for lung cancer, you kept your gorgeous spirit and that impish grin. I’m so grateful Wolfie and I were able to hold you in your last moments. I will see you in our next life my love.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_61>She later flooded her Instagram story with <a href=#>family photos</a> with the caption, “Forever Family.” Bertinelli and Van Halen were married from 1981 until 2007.

Wolfgang Van Halen revealed his father had stage 4 lung cancer in 2017 and later brain cancer in 2019.</p><p id=par-11_85>Van Halen died on October 6 at age 65. “I can’t believe I’m having to write this, but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning,” Wolfgang Van Halen shared on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “He was the best father I could ever ask for. Every moment I’ve shared with him on and off stage was a gift. My heart is broken and I don’t think I’ll ever fully recover from this loss. I love you so much, Pop.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBsLDAsmSvmZyav6qxjJucq6yZo7KtuMhmmZ6bn6KytHnEpqatoZ%2Bjrq15w66poqaXYrWmvoyfoKurpGKusbzEmqmappOaeqKy056pZp2UmbamedWapWagkaGyr7%2BMnZyarJhirqW5yK2roqaXYsCpsdJmnqimlWLBsHnTnq%2BtZZieum6tjJ%2BcsGWUpMemuoytoKado2O1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./typo-iphone-keyboard-review.html><span>←</span><span>Typo iPhone keyboard case review</span></a>
