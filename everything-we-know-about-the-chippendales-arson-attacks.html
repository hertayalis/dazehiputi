The result was a literal paper napkin contract in which De Noia gave up his stake in the New York show in exchange for half of future profits from the touring show. De Noia expanded the touring properties to include traveling revues as well as overseas shows, making Banerjee furious that De Noia was making more money out of the deal than he was. It turned out that Banerjee had been willing to turn to crime to keep his Chippendales empire powerful before he even met De Noia. In 1978, he hired his associate Ray Colon to organize arson attacks against other nightclubs he saw as threats.&nbsp;</p><p>As reported by <a href=#>Think Magazine</a>, in 1979, Banerjee targeted Moody's Disco in Santa Monica, California; the attack was unsuccessful and Moody's suffered mild damages. Five years later, an associate attempted to burn down the Red Onion restaurant in Marina Del Rey, California, another venue Banerjee saw as Chippendales' competition that needed to be taken out. Once again the attack was unsuccessful and there were few damages. However, per the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, the attempts came to light in 1993 when Banerjee was indicted for ordering the 1987 <a href=#>murder</a> of Nick De Noia, who was fatally shot in the face by an assailant at his Manhattan office. The article quoted FBI special agent Charlie Parsons: "The basic theme of the new indictment is that anybody or anything that got in Banerjee's way, he would hire somebody to kill or burn the competitor."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCBmHJwbm1fmsOmvtitn6Kml2LEpnnKp6awZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWTnbaxvMSnm5qklah6or7SqKVmmaSprqS30mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hp-stream-7-review.html><span>←</span><span>Camera, NAND, WiFi, Misc - HP Stream 7 Review: A $119 Windows Tablet</span></a>
