In a Wheel of Fortune-type format, you’ll be presented with two quotes and will have to guess the movie and television show they’re, respectively, from.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>While the guesses are technically unlimited, differing from Wordle, you only get three hints to help you. These are generally a synopsis of the film or show, the surnames of people or other keywords associated with it, and a random letter that’ll fill out some of your empty boxes.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>For example: if the film you’re looking for is Morbius, you can click the blue rectangle in the top right corner and it might deliver an “O” in the second empty box, meaning you’ll only have six more letters to guess in their correct spots.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>So, now you’ve got your head around the latest addition to the extended Wordle universe, give it a crack.
