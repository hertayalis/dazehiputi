"I had to kind of beg her," the Fixer Upper star, 48, says of the short clip featured in a carousel of pics and videos from their 18th wedding anniversary trip to Mexico. In it, wife Joanna, 45, wears a two-piece swimsuit and plunges backwards into a private pool.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d10817927c6-screenshot-2023-05-22-at-44215-pm.png><p id=enOaElDJJWz data-wc=45>Surprising no one other than the couple, the sultry moment (ultimately posted by Joanna) went viral. "It was so funny," Chip says<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;in a new interview with Deadline,</a> "I thought no one would care." National outlets and social media watchers quickly took notice, of course.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSaCjKfu2tm data-wc=48>"My friends started texting screenshots of me in that swimsuit," says Joanna in the same Deadline feature. "And I was like, 'Oh, OK. Noted. Don't do that.' I don't know if that is something you ever get used to. We feel like we're pretty normal people from Waco."</p><p id=eRtS9AnBiJO data-wc=10><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Get a glimpse of Joanna's sprawling garden at home</a></p><p id=eAWk2q6w9K data-wc=7><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Joanna's bittersweet day involving her eldest</a></p><p id=eGEE2irdGM9 data-wc=69>In other shots from the Instagram reel of their romantic vacation, the couple pose sweetly by the beach, Joanna beams in a tropical sundress as she walks across the sand, they send a nighttime message <a class=hm-link href=#>to their 5 children</a> ("Hi kids! We miss you!"), and Chip is seen lounging in a poolside chair. The highlight, though, is Joanna's viral plunge, in which she holds her nose and splashes backwards..</p><p id=e1TaHHzmw0e data-wc=16>"18 years," Joanna's caption reads. "Thankful to be on this adventure with you—happy anniversary chip gaines."</p><p id=ePFSBU3ALkN data-wc=51>"Normal" claims or not, the couple, <a class=hm-link href=#>who recently celebrated the 20th anniversary</a> of both their wedding and the launch of their home renovation business, are now bonafide multi-media moguls with their own TV network, magazine, product lines, and Waco, Tex.-based stores and restaurants all under the brand now known as Magnolia.</p><p id=e_AUJU3VThe data-wc=8><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Chip and Joanna reflect on hard times</a></p><p id=eKCoEyTFu4H_ data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Joanna Gaines shares rare glimpse of her children during 'dream' family trip</a></p><p id=eSE25NulmeK data-wc=56>"I think what's been cool about us — and what I'm proud of — goes back to that sort of naive position of when we got into this. We didn't look at something we thought was successful and then try to emulate it; try to reproduce it," Chip adds. &nbsp;"We are completely original and completely authentic."&nbsp;</p><p id=evQfx7Vo8FA data-wc=51>Their latest professional milestone is related to TV and streaming: Magnolia Network's parent company, Warner Bros Discovery, moved them under the HBO and HBO Max umbrella, which means that fans can watch Fixer Upper re-runs alongside scripted, super-premium HBO fare like&nbsp;The Sopranos, The Last of Us, The Wire&nbsp;and more.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2GbmdM8XB6 data-wc=38>"But to be in the company of those legendary writers and producers, and then here’s our little family network stapled to the back. We feel like a fly on an elephant’s rear end," Chip gushes of the honor.</p><p id=eJDiLgHlOSZ data-wc=35>When they're not running their multi-million dollar empire, the couple are parents to kids Drake, 18, Ella, 16, Duke, 14, Emmie, 13, and Crew, 4.
