Apple Watch Series 9 GPS, 41mm, Aluminium Case, Sport Band, Medium-Large, Pink/Light Pink

As well as the delightful colour, I'm excited by the new double tap gesture, where users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Series 9.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/92/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
