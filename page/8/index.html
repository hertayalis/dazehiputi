Cheesy Cauliflower Soup A creamy cheesy cauliflower soup made with fresh cauliflower, cream, sharp cheddar cheese, and bacon. A velvety smooth cream of cauliflower soup will become a winter staple in your home!
It’s officially soup season and I couldn’t be happier about it. I love stocking my fridge with all kinds of soups since they are the easiest thing to heat up for a quick, nourishing lunch. The lows are actually going to dip into the 30’s this weekend so soup is on the menu all weekend long!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>CPU ST Performance: Not Much Change from M1</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
<a href=../../apple-m1-max-performance-review.html></a>
Apple didn’t talk much about core performance of the new M1 Pro and Max, and this is likely because it hasn’t really changed all that much compared to the M1. We’re still seeing the same Firestrom performance cores, and they’re still clocked at 3.23GHz. The new chip has more caches, and more DRAM bandwidth, but under ST scenarios we’re not expecting large differences.
When we first tested the M1 last year, we had compiled SPEC under Apple’s Xcode compiler, and we lacked a Fortran compiler.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Gabi Elnicki Is Among the Non-Influencers From 'The Bachelor' Season 27 and It's Honestly Refreshing</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
<a href=../../gabi-elnicki-job-the-bachelor.html></a>
Gabi Elnicki's job outside of 'The Bachelor' is about way more than being an influencer and it proves how real the Season 27 contestant is.
Source: Instagram / @sprinkling_sunshineEven though Zach Shallcross wasn't the Bachelor lead everyone hoped for ahead of what they wanted to be a dramatic and wild season, his contestants are already creating a stir, and for good reason. Season 27 contestant Gabi Elnicki, for example, is an easy fan favorite early on, and not just because she shares a name (albeit with different spelling) as one of the Bachelorette leads from the season on which Zach originally appeared.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>I'm Replacing My Fuzzy Slipper Collection With These 6 Cozy Pairs</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
<a href=../../editor-picks-fuzzy-winter-slippers-amazon-8400623.html></a>
I have multiple pairs of slipper-like fuzzy shoes for several occasions, and I'm not afraid to wear them out and about. I wear my Ugg Tasmans similarly to my favorite sneakers. I have a cozy pair I slip into first thing in the morning and strictly only wear them around the house when I’m getting dressed. Then, I have another slip-on style with thick rubber outsoles I wear outdoors to walk the dog or grab coffee.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jackson Dean Drops the Vulnerable 'Fearless' Off at Country Radio</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
<a href=../../jackson-dean-fearless.html></a>
Jackson Dean's new radio single "Fearless" presents as a song with as much bravado as "Don't Come Lookin'," his history-making hit from 2022. Then, the young singer trips.
Sonically and lyrically, "Fearless" is as strong as his debut on Big Machine Records. Dean's full throttle vocals power through the chorus. He lists danger after danger before closing with "I'm fearless, except when it comes to you."
It's here we learn something new about the enigmatic Dean.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Meet Bake Off star Noel Fielding's partner Lliana Bird</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>

<a href=../../the-geforce-gtx-970-review-feat-evga.html></a>
Overclocking With GTX 980 we saw first-hand how GM204 had very significant overclocking headroom. Even without the ability to meaningful overvolt on NVIDIA cards, we were able to push our base GPU clock speed up from 1126MHz to 1377MHz, or in terms of the maximum boost bin, from 1265MHz to 1515MHz. Consequently with GTX 970 shipping at lower clock speeds, we have very lofty expectations here.
But running counter to that will be TDP.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Thomas Rhetts Kids: Meet the Country Star's 4 Children</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>

<a href=../../transformer-prime-gets-403-ics-update.html></a>
A couple of days earlier than originally expected, ASUS pushed out an update to its Transformer Prime bringing the tablet up to Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I brought my Prime with me to Vegas just to be ready for when this update went live. I installed the update last night and have played with the platform a bit since then. Tegra 3 definitely does a better job of handling the ICS UI compared to OMAP 4 in the Galaxy Nexus (more on this in our review tomorrow).</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/7/>← Prev Page</a>
