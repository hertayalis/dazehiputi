<a href=../../why-is-the-lint-in-my-dryer-wet-html.html></a>
Answer
Following the completion of the drying cycle, it is possible to notice condensation in the dryer drum. Typically, condensation occurs as a consequence of insufficient ventilation, which may cause moisture and lint to accumulate in the dryer‚Äôs exhaust system duct and seep back into the dryer after the dryer has been turned off.
&nbsp;
Aside from that, why is the lint in my dryer vent so dripping? A little amount of water may leak onto the floor as a result of the moisture within the dryer not being vented to the outside.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/87/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
