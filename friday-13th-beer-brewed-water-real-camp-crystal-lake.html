I figured how cool would it be to&nbsp;make beer……from actual Crystal Lake water!?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Friday-The-13th-Remake-2009-Steelbook-Best-Buy.jpg><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, this product won’t be available for the majority of us, given that Krzeminski only nabbed a few gallons of the stuff. But, the fact that it exists at all is still a lot of fun to think about.</p><p>“These are purely for personal consumption and gifts for friends/family. I’m not selling these or anything of that sort. If I am fortunate enough to be invited back to camp by the generous folks at Crystal Lake Tours (CLT), I would be thrilled to get the opportunity to make more. At the end of the day, this project of mine would have never left the ground if it weren’t for the generosity and goodwill of the people at CLT.</p><p>If anything were to come of this, I’d truly love for the outcome to be more people directed to the website and buy souvenirs, tour tickets or merchandise to support the camp and to keep ‘Camp Crystal Lake’ thriving so future fans and scouts can still see this place and enjoy the experiences as much as I really have.”</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>So, to reiterate, it sounds like this stuff isn’t going to hit the market anytime soon – though the fact that the idea was not only made, but actually materialized is awesome.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=false>As for Jason Voorhees himself, we don’t know when exactly he’ll be wreaking havoc on the screen again.
