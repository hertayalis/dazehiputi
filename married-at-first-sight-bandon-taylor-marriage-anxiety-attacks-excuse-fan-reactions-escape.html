At the moment, it looks unrepairable. Even though experts on 'Married At First Sight' have tried to get the two on the same page, they have inherent issues that will take time to iron out.&nbsp;</p><p>On the second day of their honeymoon, Brandon gave Taylor the silent treatment for making a funny tape of him snoring. He thought it was disrespectful but refused to bring it up until they were with the other couples by the pool.</p><p>Brandon is a private person and cameras can prove to be bothersome for someone who is not a very open person. He got into a tiff of sorts with the production crew for following him around. He needed 10 minutes by himself to clear his head but that couldn't be granted because his every move had to be on camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Too many people, excessive social interactions and social media irk Brandon. However, that shouldn't prompt bad behavior. Abandoning conversations and leaving a chat mid-way citing anxiety as a primary reason is something both Taylor and fans of the show have found to be weird.&nbsp;</p><p>"Brandon seems to only have anxiety or a panic disorder when it suits his preference," a fan wrote on Reddit, while another shared: "I noticed that too. And as someone with diagnosed issues, it infuriated me deeply that he tried to use his 'panic attack' as an out when there are many who end up in the ER repeatedly for them."&nbsp;</p><p>"I have anxiety and panic disorder and watching Brandon blame his anger and irritability on a 'panic attack' really got under my skin," another fan pointed out. "Brandon has the emotional maturity of a squash," a user posted.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Taylor's behavior hasn't been top-notch as well. She had shared a video on Instagram talking about the qualities she'd like in a man adding that she would probably be single all her life. This put Brandon off and he left their house in order to process what had happened. He expected an apology, which Taylor refused to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch all the new episodes of 'Married At First Sight' on Lifetime every Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZGnv6qxw2aYrWWWnr%2B0wIysoKCgpGKvorrDqKVmrJGuubC%2BjKaYq6qZlrSmecCnr6KdpK56osDTmpqkq12axaTB0p5kn5meYr%2BmrcKtoKimo2KytK%2FAqZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./your-grace-and-mercy-html.html><span>←</span><span> Mississippi Mass Choir Your Grace</span></a>
