If you feel like your bum could do with a little lift and sculpt, the pants will come to the rescue.</p><p id=e0seq1vMj_ data-wc=12>After the debate over the pants, Kate said they were "extremely comfy".&nbsp;</p><h2>Marks & Spencer's bum lift pants - what do they do?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eMPeCj5e1B data-wc=42>Think of them as a padded bra, but for your butt. The curve enhancing shapewear won't launch in stores until May. Soozie Hebkinson, head of lingerie design at M&S said: "We've been doing for bums what we've done for boobs for years."</p><p id=eeu5g3m567 data-wc=65>Let's face it, what would we do without M&S and its trusty underwear department? The retailer sells 45 bras every minute and with this new launch, I'm expecting huge numbers will be flocking to try out the new BBS - bum-boosting shorts. M&S isn't the first to stock a pair of solution pants like this; Skims offers padded pants, as does the shapewear brand Spanx.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Best shapewear: From M&S to Spanx, Skims, John Lewis & MORE" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/24d298bb9796-best-shapewear-for-women.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Best shapewear: From M&S to Spanx, Skims, John Lewis & MORE" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Best shapewear: From M&S to Spanx, Skims, John Lewis & MORE</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2>My thoughts</h2><p id=e9HwArZgTy data-wc=76>I've seen them up close and personal at a recent press viewing and well, these aren't messing around. If I wanted a Kim Kardashian-style bum, I might just get one with these - no squats needed. As someone who is lacking shape and definition in that department, I know these will add some lift and contour for when I need it. For example, if I buy a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>body-skimming satin dress</a> or a pair of slim-fit trousers.</p><p id=esUZhJN-Tq data-wc=53>I asked my friend, fashion stylist <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Antonia Krasowski</a> for her views on the new pants from M&S, and she said: "From a personal point, I have no need as I've got junk in my trunk but if it stops people having dangerous surgery then I'm all for a little padding in your pants."&nbsp;</p><p id=eLOj9E2koR data-wc=28>And she has a point, in recent years Brazilian butt lift surgeries have become popular worldwide, and not only are they dangerous, they're expensive, costing well over £7000.</p><p id=ezKi_4_JMv data-wc=27>I love that the M&S bum lift pants are only £15, which is less of an investment as some of the other pricier pants on the market.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/73e87127a34d-spanx-booty-boost.jpg></a><p>The Spanx Suit Your Fancy Butt Enhancer shaping shorts can be worn with or without pads and they are graded by size for a natural look.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£78 AT ASOS</p></a><p id=eCWd0bGkFC3></p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/725119446575-skims-pants.jpg></a><p>Made from sculpting compression stretch fabric, the SKIMS pair has gumming to keep the elasticated, high-rise waistband in place.<br></p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£58 AT SKIMS VIA NETAPORTER</p></a><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84e02bf00dbd-fabletics-bum-lift.jpg></a><p>The super-high waist shorts feature an innovative booty sling that gives your assets a lift.
