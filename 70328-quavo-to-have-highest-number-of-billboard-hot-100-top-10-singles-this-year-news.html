Beginning with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Migos</a> and their runaway hit "Bad and Boujee," the&nbsp;Georgia emcee has put his name on some of the biggest hits of the year so far, including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Khaled</a>'s "I’m The One" (which fittingly peaked at No. 1), <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Post Malone</a>'s "Congratulations" (which peaked at No. 8) and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>'s "Portland" (also peaked at No. 8). Now, with this week's&nbsp;Billboard singles chart moving&nbsp;"Strip That Down," his collaboration with one-time One Direction member Liam Payne, into the No. 10 spot&nbsp;on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the Hot 100</a>, Quavo now owns the most Top Ten singles of any artist so far in 2017.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No pop, hip-hop or R&B has had more visibility than Quavo, who has fashioned himself a red-hot solo career to go along with the success of his rap trio Migos, where he performs alongside Offset and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Takeoff</a>. That ATL group may have been the starting point, but the man who may not have been a well-known commodity is now a performer that is on every hitmaker's list to work with in the studio. There's even been a petition for the rapper to help redo the most famous song Americans have ever known, the Star Spangled Banner. When <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a petition</a>&nbsp;began circulating to have Quavo re-interpret the centuries-old song that is inextricably linked to the history of the United States, the world's most famous featured artist had this to say:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“There’s a lot going behind the National anthem. I would love to do it, but I wanna do like a 2017 National anthem for both people & all races” Quavo said. “Something thats representing now. Something that representing the modern day national anthem. So I think if I got with some good musicians and just write something that’s very strong & powerful.” That message on inclusivity, stemming perhaps from his penchant for spreading his talents around on different tracks that don't necessarily stay in the hip-hop genre, is something that got many fans excited about the prospect of his involvement with the National Anthem down the road. However unlikely it is to happen, it wouldn't be a stretch to have another song of his being sung by millions of listeners in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p><br><h2>Quavo</h2></p><p>Quavo To Have Highest Number Of Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 Singles This Year</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZYBzhIyqrJqun2LBsHnHmq2eZZietKmx0q1kp62dl7Kzec6fZJuhnKGvsK3RnWShp6RifnF8jK2mqWVhZXq0tc2go56rXam1qr%2BMspyaql2jsri%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jewellianna-palencia.html><span>←</span><span>Jewellianna Palencia</span></a>
