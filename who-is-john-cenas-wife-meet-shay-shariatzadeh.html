Meet Shay Shariatzadeh – John Felix Anthony Cena, born on April 23, 1977, is an extraordinary American professional wrestler, actor, and former rapper who currently showcases his talents under the banner of WWE.</strong></p><p>Revered for holding the most world championship reigns in WWE history, <a href=# rel=noopener>Cena</a> is widely recognized as one of the greatest professional wrestlers to have ever graced the industry.</p><p>Cena’s journey commenced in 1998 when he relocated to California with aspirations of becoming a bodybuilder. However, fate had a different path in store for him, leading him towards the world of professional wrestling in 1999. His debut took place in the realm of Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), marking the genesis of his awe-inspiring career.</p><p>Subsequently, in 2001, John Cena signed with the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE) and was assigned to its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). During his time in OVW, he etched his name in history by capturing the OVW Heavyweight Championship and OVW Southern Tag Team Championship.</p><p>John Cena’s breakthrough moment arrived when he made the move to SmackDown in 2002, adopting the persona of a brash, trash-talking rapper. This transformation propelled him into the limelight, catapulting him to fame and fortune.</p><p>In 2005, he secured the illustrious WWE Championship, initiating a transition into a virtuous, heroic character, often described as a “goody-two shoes Superman.” Cena’s unrivaled talent and charismatic presence solidified his status as the franchise player and public face of WWE for the following decade.</p><p>A holder of an unprecedented 16 world championship titles, Cena boasts an extraordinary record of 13 WWE Championship reigns and three World Heavyweight Championship victories. Additionally, he has clinched the WWE United States Championship five times, the WWE Tag Team Championship and World Tag Team Championship twice each, and emerged triumphant in the Royal Rumble twice.</p><p>Furthermore, John Cena emerged victorious in the Money in the Bank match on one occasion. He has also headlined numerous illustrious WWE pay-per-view events, including the pinnacle of them all, WrestleMania, an incredible five times.</p><p>While John Cena’s wrestling career has garnered a mix of critical and audience responses, he has consistently earned acclaim for his compelling character work and unparalleled promotional skills, despite occasional criticism for his perceived dominance and screen time compared to other wrestlers.</p><p>Beyond the realm of professional wrestling, John Cena has successfully ventured into the world of acting. His acting talents have been showcased in various noteworthy projects, with notable performances in films such as “The Marine” (2006), “Trainwreck” (2015), “Ferdinand” (2017), “Blockers,” and “Bumblebee” (both 2018).</p><p>In 2021, Cena starred as Jakob Toretto in “F9,” reprising his role in the upcoming “Fast X” (2023). He also portrayed the captivating character of Peacemaker in “The Suicide Squad” (2021) and the eponymous television series (2022–present). Adding another feather to his cap, Cena released his solo studio album, “You Can’t See Me” in 2005, which achieved platinum certification.</p><p>Apart from his remarkable contributions to the world of entertainment, Cena is renowned for his extensive involvement in charitable endeavors, particularly with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. His genuine compassion and dedication have led him to grant over 650 wishes, a remarkable feat that highlights his commitment to making a positive impact beyond the realm of fame and success.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is John Cena’s Wife? Meet Shay Shariatzadeh</h2><p>During the promotion of his film “12 Rounds” in 2009, John Cena made an announcement regarding his engagement to Elizabeth Huberdeau. The couple tied the knot on July 11, 2009. However, their marriage faced difficulties, and on May 1, 2012, Cena filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized on July 18 of the same year.</p><p>Following the separation, Cena entered a romantic relationship with fellow wrestler Nikki Bella later in 2012. Their relationship blossomed, and Cena proposed to Nikki Bella at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, 2017. Unfortunately, their engagement came to an end in April 2018, just weeks before their scheduled wedding on May 5.</p><p>In early 2019, Cena found love again and started dating <a href=# rel=noopener>Shay Shariatzadeh</a>, whom he had met during the production of his film “Playing with Fire” in Vancouver. Their relationship flourished, and on October 12, 2020, the couple exchanged vows in a private ceremony held in Tampa, Florida.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqru8enZJydnpbAbsPIn5xmpZWawW6%2Fx5qwZquYlr%2BqrdOzmJ2dmGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-travis-kelce-dating-show-explained.html><span>←</span><span>The Travis Kelce dating show, explained</span></a>
