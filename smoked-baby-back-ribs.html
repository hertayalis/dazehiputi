A good BBQ Rub will have a combination of ingredients to provide saltiness, a touch of spice, smokiness, and sweetness. The key is to have a variety of herbs and spices.&nbsp; A perfect BBQ rub starts with sugar, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, dry mustard, chili powder, cumin, paprika, and pepper.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Smoking-Baby-Back-Ribs.jpg alt="Traeger Grill.

The beauty of smoking is the flavors it infuses into the meats. Traeger wood pellet grills pack big hardwood flavor, from sweet cherry, to savory mesquite, into everything you grill, smoke, bake, roast, braise, & BBQ.&nbsp; Grilling has never been easier—just set it and forget it and let the Traeger work its wood-fired magic.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Smoked-Baby-Back-Ribs-4-crop.jpg alt="Smoked Baby Back Ribs.

These Baby Back Ribs,&nbsp;seasoned and wrapped tightly in foil, can be cooked in a 350-degree oven for 2 hours. Once they become tender, open up the foil and slather with your favorite BBQ sauce. Turn up the oven to 425 degrees and cook for 30 minutes, leaving the foil open at the top to create a glaze.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Smoked-Baby-Back-Ribs-3-cropped.jpg alt="Smoked Baby Back Ribs.
