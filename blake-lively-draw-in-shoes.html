From their infamous plantation wedding discourse to the constant chaffing of each other on social media, Lively and Reynolds are sure to always lurk in the collective periphery of those who remain—for better or for worse—very online.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The latest fodder to 2020's churning nightmare wheel came on a brisk, fall Thursday afternoon. The Gossip Girl actress posted a photo of herself and her husband posing with what appears to be voting ballots, signaling that, yes, the couple are indeed good citizens doing their civic duty, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was Ryan's first time," she joked in the caption. "He was understandably scared. It all happened so fast. Like, REALLY fast. He wept. I pretended to weep. Then he called all his friend. #voteearly"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More fascinating to the layman celebrity observer, however, was not the virtue signaling hashtag but the fact that Lively's shoes—a pair of brown strappy heels—appeared to be drawn on. Judging from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/BlakeLivelyBR/status/1319370210575605769?s=20" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her Instagram story" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">her Instagram story</a>, she was also in on the joke.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There's something to be said about rich celebrities (who can virtually afford any pair of the season's trendiest pumps) drawing DSW knockoffs onto their own bare feet. It's quite possible Lively was bored, as humans tend to get, or simply did not want her naked feet to circulate the Internet, understandable for reasons that don't need to be explicated. Either way, if Lively is forgoing her own shoes, then she can feel free to send a pair of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/telfar/black-logo-high-boots/5806761 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Telfar's Logo High Boots " data-vars-ga-product-id=4973d013-219b-4413-9785-edb3e9e1b9ae data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/telfar/black-logo-high-boots/5806761 data-product-url=https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/telfar/black-logo-high-boots/5806761 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://ssense.prf.hn/click/camref:1101luWDd/pubref:har%7Cxid%3A{xid}/destination:https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/telfar/black-logo-high-boots/5806761 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"be8b7ab2-3c20-4a38-8da4-56961185bb00","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"888466","merchant_name":"SSENSE","network_name":"PHG","network_id":"8","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://ssense.prf.hn/click/camref:1101luWDd/pubref:{subid}/destination:https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/telfar/black-logo-high-boots/5806761","network_name":"pt","appended_link":"https://ssense.prf.hn/click/camref:1101luWDd/pubref:{subid}%7Cxid%3A{xid}/destination:https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/telfar/black-logo-high-boots/5806761","last_updated_at":"2024-05-02 21:16:38.379784"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=fe460448-fd87-47b0-9fae-89f489ab1bba class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Telfar's Logo High Boots </a>my way, at least.
