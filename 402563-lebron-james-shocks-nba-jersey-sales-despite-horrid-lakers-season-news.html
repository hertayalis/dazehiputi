So things are a bit bleak at the moment.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But that doesn't mean the team hasn't had some wins this NBA season, with one particular W located in the jersey department. Recently releasing the stats for this year's jersey sales, the NBA has tallied that the Lakeshow holds the number one spot--more specifically, LeBron James. So apparently, the team being historically bad isn't enough of a repellent to keep NBA fans from getting their hands on King James gear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/48/76/277648_8d90d0f1d19b42886ff08953071a0d34.jpg><p><h6>(Meg Oliphant/Getty Images)</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following the King sitting atop the throne is Stephen Curry at #2, Giannis Antetokounmpo at #3, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kevin Durant</a> at #4, and Mavs superstar Luka Doncic sitting at #5. Unfortunately, the only other Laker to find their way onto the best-selling jersey list is Anthony Davis coming in at #7; I guess you have to take the good with the bad, though, right?&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Did you expect this Lakers team to be bad?
