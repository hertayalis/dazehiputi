The company pulled out all the stops to make it a night to remember, as quite a few legends and Hall of Famers were part of the show. However, due to it being such a loaded show, it seems WWE did not deliver on an advertised match for the show.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of WWE RAW this week.</a></p><p>As seen on this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW, fans were greeted with a wave of nostalgia, especially those who had been watching WWE’s flagship show since the very beginning.</p><p>Bobby Lashley took on defending champion Austin Theory for the United States Championship on this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW in the main event of the show. Then things took quite a turn in the main event.</p><p>The match ended in an <a href=#>unexpected way after Brock Lesnar made his shocking return to WWE</a> and destroyed both Lashley and Theory, costing Lashley the match in the process. This was a big surprise for the Philly fans, but it also meant that the company nixed their advertised dark match.</p><p>According to a report by <a href=#>PW Insider</a>, WWE failed to deliver on the Philly Street Fight between Seth Rollins and Austin Theory, which the company had advertised in the past. After Brock Lesnar’s appearance, there was no use to get the crowd even more hyped up.</p><p>There was no post-taping dark segment. Austin Theory vs. Seth Rollins in a Street Fight had been advertised but that wasn’t going to happen after Brock Lesnar wrecked Bobby Lashley and Theory.</p><p>WWE clearly has huge plans for Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley, as it is likely they will duke it out at WrestleMania 39 in April. In the meantime, we’ll have to see how the company will book their feud in the coming weeks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
