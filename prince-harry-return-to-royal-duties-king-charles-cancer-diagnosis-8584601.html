He has since postponed all "public-facing duties" but continues to "undertake State business and official paperwork" from home. Kate, meanwhile, isn't expected to attend any royal engagements until after Easter.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just yesterday, Harry hinted that there could be a potential reconciliation between himself and his family while speaking with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Good Morning America</a>'s Will Reeve about his father's health. When asked if Charles's diagnosis could have a "reunifying effect," Harry replied: "Absolutely. Yeah, I'm sure. Throughout all these families, I see it on a day-to-day basis, the strength of the family unit coming together."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z6ugp5uVYrWivtGyZKudpKq%2Fr3nTqGSrp6mWuW6w1K2gnqtdoLavs4ycn5qqnJrAbq%2FAp5qeql2ZtqKzzaiqoqtdbYJ5gJVpaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kiely-williams-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Kiely Williams Net Worth 2024</span></a>
