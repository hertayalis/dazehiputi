<a href=../../../the-apple-thunderbolt-display-review.html></a>

You lose some of the resolution of the older 30-inch panels but you get a much more compact form factor that feels far less overwhelming on a desk. Having the 27-inch display exclusively for the past year I can honestly say that I don't miss the 30. I've mentioned before that I'm more productive on a single high resolution display vs.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Happy 38th Birthday, Rose Byrne!
