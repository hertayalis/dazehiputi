On paper, a high concept sci-fi action thriller produced by Sam Raimi that was written and directed by the creators of A Quiet Place and starred Adam Driver in the lead role was an unmissable opportunity for a genre-bending romp destined to find cult classic status, or at the very least become a midnight madness favorite. Sadly, 65 was nothing but a chore to sit through.
