Following the movie's theatrical release in the United States last year, director Michael Matthews told Decider: <strong>"There's been some discussion about it. I've got a few interesting ideas.</strong> But we did focus on this just being its own movie.</p><p id=e8uoIdfdqMzO data-wc=43>"It's not the approach of, 'How do we start a franchise?'
