And while the ink is still wet on the parchment, fans are already conjuring up their dream cast. Topping the list for the role of the infamous Lord Voldemort? None other than Irish actor Cillian Murphy.</p><p>“So far, officially, there is no one from the casting confirmed, because so far, only the production has been confirmed,” says a source close to the project.</p><p>But that hasn’t stopped the fandom from diving into heated debates and speculative discussions, especially on platforms like Reddit.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/QPtXksr.jpg alt="Fans Are Rooting for Cillian Murphy to Be the Next Voldemort in Upcoming Harry Potter HBO Max Series" width=750 height=375 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Cillian_Murphy_is_the_Fan-Favorite_for_Voldemort></span>Why Cillian Murphy is the Fan-Favorite for Voldemort<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Murphy, known for his versatile roles in films like “28 Days Later” and “The Dark Knight,” and more recently “Oppenheimer,” has a certain dark allure that fans believe would make him the perfect Voldemort.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iTFcFwK.jpg alt="Fans Are Rooting for Cillian Murphy to Be the Next Voldemort in Upcoming Harry Potter HBO Max Series" width=750 height=754 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“The proposal of Cillian Murphy as the dark lord is more from the fans, but it could reach the ears of those who produce the series and take the suggestion,” notes a hopeful fan.</p><p>The series, which has received the blessing of J.K. Rowling, promises to stick closely to the books, potentially offering details that the original films skipped over. This faithfulness to the source material is one of the reasons fans are rallying behind Murphy, who they feel could bring a nuanced depth to the character of Tom Riddle, the man who would become Voldemort.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Other_Contenders_in_the_Magical_Ring></span>Other Contenders in the Magical Ring<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/P9rxk3H.jpg alt="Fans Are Rooting for Cillian Murphy to Be the Next Voldemort in Upcoming Harry Potter HBO Max Series" width=720 height=479 data-sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>While Murphy seems to be the fan-favorite, he’s not the only name being tossed into the Sorting Hat. English actors <a href=#>Christian Bale</a> and <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch</a> have also been mentioned. However, Murphy seems to be the most convincing choice for the majority of Harry Potter aficionados.</p><p>“Especially because they closely resemble the character of Tom Riddle, before becoming Lord Voldemort,” says a fan, making a case for Murphy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Long_Road_to_the_Dark_Arts></span>A Long Road to the Dark Arts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With the series speculated to premiere between 2025 and 2026, there’s still plenty of time for casting decisions to be made. But one thing is clear: fans are eager to see their visions come to life.</p><p>“Let’s keep our fingers crossed!” exclaims a fan, summing up the collective sentiment.</p><p>So, will <a href=#>Cillian Murphy</a> trade in his Peaky Blinders cap for a dark wizard’s robe? Only time will tell, but the prospect has certainly cast a spell on the Harry Potter community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2idmqajYq6zsYyrpqismaO0brLOq2ScoZyhtqK6jKasq6iYrnq1u4ybnGasmJp6r7HXrWSvp5yZsq670a1koqZdqr2ku8yipaBlmJa%2Fs8WMqaatrJWneqmuzmakmrBdqLKztcSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cooke-maroney-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Cooke Maroney Net Worth: How Much Does He Earn in His Career?</span></a>
