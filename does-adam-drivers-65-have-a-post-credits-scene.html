The movie was directed and written by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods and sees Adam Driver’s Mills go up against some dinosaurs. Set 65 million years ago, Mills is the pilot of a spaceship that is carrying passengers to another planet on a journey that will take him two years. Unfortunately, along the way he passes through an asteroid field, knocking him off course into a mysterious planet and killing nearly everyone on board.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>It turns out that the planet is Earth, and it is the Cretaceous period, so it is filled with dinosaurs. One traveler managed to survive the crash in her pod, a little girl named Koa (Ariana Greenblatt). But, Mills has trouble communicating to her that the pair need to escape by using the one escape pod left because they don’t speak the same language and his translator is broken. So, he spends most of the movie attempting to keep her safe from dinosaurs.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>The movie isn’t too long, coming in at a reasonable 93 minutes. Yet, even though the film only has a few actors in it, the credits are surprisingly long, undoubtedly for all of the visual effects artists who worked on the film. Because of the long credits you might be wondering if 65 has anything after the credits that is worth you sitting through them, so let’s take a look.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-there-anything-after-the-credits-of-65 data-injectable=false>Is there anything after the credits of 65?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Koa-in-65.jpg><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>Despite the long credits, there is no extra scene at the end or during the credits. You will not see Adam Driver or the dinosaurs once the credits begin to roll. However, if you stay for the first minute or so, you will see that the landscape has sprouted some skyscrapers. It’s unlikely that this is Earth, as it was 65 million years ago. Instead, it’s probably Koa or Mills’ home planet, signaling that they made it to their destination safely.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>So, if you want to leave once the movie ends, you can feel free to give your ushers a bit of a head start. Or if you want to watch the names of all the people who worked on the movie you can do that too. After all, the dinosaurs in 65 did look pretty cool.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>You can watch Adam Driver’s new movie 65 while it is in theaters now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2Kupa3MZpuroaaav7R5lW5koZmmmnqiec%2Boqq1lk6eypbXTrGSsm5WjsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celia-shatzman-7109182.html><span>←</span><span>Celia Shatzman - InStyle</span></a>
